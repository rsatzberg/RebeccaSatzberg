<p> Hello! 
	My name is Rebecca, I am currently a junior at the University of New Haven studying Music and Sound Recording with minors in Economics and Theater Arts. I am from Maryland, love animals, being outdoors,and binging tv shows. I have an immense love of musical theater, all things Disney, and happy endings. I am a child at heart, and always will be. I find joy in the smallest things, including a rubber duck collection that is ever growing. 
	<br>
	<br>
	My favorite tv shows include Parks and Recreation, Friends and Modern Family. My favorite broadway shows include Wicked, Waitress and Cabaret. My favorite Disney movie, though hard to narrow down, is Moana.  </p>
