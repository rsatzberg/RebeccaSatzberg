<h2>Musical Theater</h2>

<p> I began working with my university's theater department in the fall of 2018, and worked with the wireless microphones and Qlab for our production of Cabaret. I continued into the spring of 2019, running the sound board for Cabaret 5 (a musical review) and as the foley artist for our production of Mr. Burns: A Post Electric Play. Above is a picture of the board I mixed Cabaret 5 on.

For Mr. Burns, as the foley artist, I got to experience a different side of musical theater. For act one, I had no foley sounds and worked as part of the stage crew/run crew. During act two, I stayed backstage, and created the sound of a bathtub running (using two buckets and pouring water back and forth) which was supposed to be slightly wrong (included the water stopping and starting again) as this was part of the storyline of act two. I also provided the sound of rain using a rainstick at the end of act two, eluding to the storms to come in act three. For act three, I was on stage as part of the chorus. This was my first stage experience. I was able to make it through, and I really enjoyed and learned from the experience. Act three consisted of storm sounds throughout, and I used a thunder tube and had other chorus members utilize rain sticks to create the storm sounds. I also continued to work as part of the stage crew/run crew.

My experience with my university's theater department has brought out a love of working in theater I didn't know I had. This quickly became the career I hope to pursue, specifically working sound for musical theater.  </p>
